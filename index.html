      <p class="salutation">My sweetest Mishy,</p>
      <p>Hi princess. Happy 24th month anniversary. Happy 2 years anniversary.
We've came a long way. A long long long way. And I'd like to start this speech with how much I appreciate you. But for that let's look into my past alright? 
Since I was in school I've always felt neglected. Ignored. Useless. Even though I was doing right on lower grades. I did well but I've always felt alone. In school activities. And even when I ask teacher to teach me stuffs also. They would ignore me and go. They wouldn't care. Whether I learnt something or not it never mattered to them. And outside the school also kulhen gossa. They wouldn't really want to participate me in gamed and stuff. They would say stuffs like it's not fair. I'm too good. I'm too strong. And I was forced to play with elder people. People In grade 9, 10, I can't play the game well. Cause they are better and more stronger obviously. I'm no match for them. I get scolded. Shouted but I still go cause I still want to play nevertheless what they say or want me to do. And even at home also. If I do 1 thing also wrong. That's it for me. I can't go out. I can only go out from 4-6. That's if I read quran 3 times and do all the homework and do everything my mom asks. That's how it was. And if I can't come exactly at 6 they will not send me for a few days. It's painful to grow up like that but I can't complain yours was almost same too. 
Growing up like this I faced a lot of problems. Getting beaten up. Daily bullies and stuff like that even from families. It's alright I knew better days were there. So that I believed it. After a few years I dated my classmate laisa. I felt like this is it. The better days are this. This is it I'm gonna be with her forever. Cause mostly people date online. And they breakup within a few months cause its online. But since laisa was from rashun I felt like this is it. We would be together forever. Reality hit me and I realised this was just a trial of affection. A single drop from the ocean. Then I met Rishmy and sadha. Same as laisa. It ended. After that I met hashma. I felt like I found the one. I've never been so happy edhuahaa hama ah edhuah. I thought to myself this would be the happiest. I thought I'd get married cause she treated me good first month therey. I told my mom about her I felt like dhuniye ranvihen. Didn't realise its the downfall of my life. You know most of the stuff happened. And that led to me overdosing. In those painful days I met afaaf. She was there for me for like a month. I felt like wow. She might be the one. And no I didn't love her. I liked her by the way she treated me. It also ended. And went back to hashma. Things happened. Hashma blamed you and brokeup. I met you. But this girl is different. I wasn't excited when I met you. Honestly. I was really hurt. I was hurt u were not mine. But hashma rishme sadha . I was excited when I talked and dated them. I felt like I got something. But you. When I talked to you it really hurted. It felt like something that belongs to me isn't mine yet. I was frustrated. Annoyed. Hurt that u weren't mine. Never felt like that. After a week. I found myself begging to Allah. To make you mine. Cried begged till I had no voice. That raccon voice. I lied saying I had a roaga. Truth is I lost it crying for you. The crying wasn't on purpose. It felt like a breakup. It felt like something that belongs to me isn't mine and it hurted alot. But I prayed days. There was this one moment. It just felt unreal. Felt like a portal opened. Felt like this is the moment. So I asked. Who is the person u like. And we started dated indirectly. 
</p>
      <p>Even though I didn't realise it. My life lit up from that moment. Felt like I can abandon the entire world. All the problems and go to u and find peace. I wasn't wrong. That wasn't a feeling. That was reality. U became my home. Whether I am happy sad or depressed hurt or mad. U handled me like a wife I wanted to love you more and more. More and more and more and more and more and more. And I did. I did soo much I loved you soo much. But you broke the trust when u brokeup. We started again. Again and again time over time and time over time. Struggles arguments. Harshships. Painful words. Shouting. Hurting. Everything. We handled them. We didn't leave each other. We were happy to each other. Times when we were hurt by each other. Times when we mere mad by each other. Times when we were disgusted by each other. Times when we were annoyed by each other. Times when we got bored by doing nothing and by staying in call. But did we leave? No we pushed through it. We pushed through everything. Every single thing that came to us. Every single rock people throwd to us. We healed we covered and we came through. And I began to love you unimaginably. I married you. I loved your eyes. Your nose. Your lips. Your eyebrows. Your cheeks. Your tongue. Your eye wrinkles. Your forehead. Your nails. Your fingers. Young hand. Young skin. Your palm. Your neck. Your shoulders. Your chest. Your stomach. Your belly and belly button. Your vagina. Your thighs. Your ass. Your legs. Your toes. How you look at me. How you touch me. How you talk. How you smell. How you taste. How you walk. How you cry how you smile how you laugh. How you get mad. I loved every single detail of you. How you have a soft heart and a protective boundaries. How your loyal and loving only towards me. How you listen to me. How you try to explain things to me. How you try to clear misunderstandings. How you get hurt when I go silent. How talkative you are. I really love these things about you. Words like this can't even describe. How am I gonna tell you how I love you moaning. Sleeping. Cuddling. Hugging. Kissing. Touching you. I love doing every single thing with you and every single thing you do. It's just unimaginably cute and hot. I've loved you consistently. I love you continuously. And I will love you unconditionally.
      <p>Since its our 2 year anniversary I'll tell my dream. When everything is over. We move to a beyru gaumakah. Far away from city. In the woods. A big house that looks fancy but old fashion. Like a luxury but royal vibe giving house. At least 30min drive to there. Having 1 twin and 1 more kid. Me and you 1 room. The twins 1 room and the other child of ours 1 room too. 1 room to pray and 1 room for me to manage all my works. The room for praying I'd like a mosq with led lights. And a library and a room for the kids to study. Now a sitting room with a TV and a really comfy sofa and the kitchen should be really big and really classy. And the dining room to be in the kitchen. I want it to be a long table like the tables in royal house. That's the house. And inside the city. I want to have owned a lot of businesses like real estates. Hotels. Guest Houses. Stuffs like that that generates money always. And a black car with bulletproof windows. Our kids will go to a private tutor I hire. Everyday we will wake up. I will make them deciplied so the wake up on their own. And we both will wake up. Go to shower together. Get ready together. And we will go to kitchen and we both will prepare breakfast. Maybe toast some breads. Almost 10 breads. And ill rub butter on 5 of them u rub jam on 5 of them and we make them jam and butter sandwiches and something to drink. We will sit. I'll sit at the hima baa of the table. Only 1 person can sit there cause its hima baa. You will sit right side of me. My kid will sit left side of me. And one of twin next to you and one of the twin next to our other child. After breakfast we All go to car. We will go drop the 3 kids to tutor and we both will go do my business works and check how it's going. And I'll go back to hour house. You will help me with my works managing the papers in my office room and I'll do the works. You will be my assistant in that office of mine In our house. After like a long time we will go pick our kids up and come home. Eat lunch. We both will make chicken or something like that. Sometimes definitely tasty cause my princess knows how to cool tasty food. I love you so much. Anyways we will eat and we will go sitting room ah. Maybe 4 of us play games. If go to library and study a bit or me and u go to working room and finish unfinished works of the day and they both go to their study room and study and around evening ish we will go to somewhere nice. Maybe a museum. A theater to watch a movie. A gaming house. Somewhere nice and classy. Then we will go to eat dinner when it's late. To a restaurant. We will stay at one table and laugh and make jokes and eat well.  Then we go home we make sure our kids are on bed and we go take a long shower together and sleep. And on every Friday all of us clean the house really well so there won't be any dust throughout the weekdays.
      <p>Anyways... that's my dream. And by the time you finish reading this I'm probably asleep. If I had to guess its already 12:15. Listen. No need to say thank you or anything for writing this. Do this. Cut the call and call again. So I wake-up. Without saying anything start kissing. As deep and as hard as u can kiss me. Till I get hard. When I'm hard enough rub it in your vagina. When your wet fuck me. Ride me. Till you cum. Till there's no energy In you. Ride me as hard as you can. While riding cry. Be happy sad or joyful. Ride and tel me everything about how you feel. If ur sad Ride me and tell me. If your happy Ride me and tell me. Just start funking me without saying a word and tell me how you feel. Happy 2 year anniversary. May Allah bring is together and never separate me from my righteous wife. Aameen
      <p>Happy 2 years, my love ❤️</p>
